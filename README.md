all the configuration colors or icons are defined by MaterializeCSS, you can find the documentation here: https://materializecss.com/

### Blocks

these are elements that you can use again later when you are building your pages, these can be brand specific elements like a logo or a footer or they can be generic elements like a text block or a button. You can define the content of these blocks in the frontend.

#### Categories

first you need to add `BlockCategories`, go to `/admin/landingbuilder/blockcategory/add/` and add
for example:
**Title:** `navigation`, **Color:** `gray`
**Title:** `section`, **Color:** `red`

these categories are later used in the drag and drop editor to group the blocks

#### Adding a blocks

then you can add `Blocks`, go to `/admin/landingbuilder/block/add/` and add the following:

**Identifier** *unique name for block without spaces*: `navbar_1`
**Label** *name that is displayed to you*: `Navbar`
**Category** *now select one of the above defined categories*: `navigation`
**Content** *html, css and javascript you can leave blanc for now*
**Fa icon** *font awesome icon to display in drag and drop editor*: `fa-solid fa-compass`

### Pages
